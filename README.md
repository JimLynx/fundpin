## Version Control

- Used Git for version control.
- User-confirmation branch for implementing and testing confirmation modal dialogues.
- The branch was then merged with the main branch after any conflicts were addressed.

### IDE

- All code was written on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a local IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
- A virtual environment was created on VSCode to ensure that the packages installed are only installed in the virtual environment folder.
- The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/JimLynx/givetu).

## Deployment

### Local Installation

#### 1. Cloning the project

- The code can be run locally through clone or download from the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/JimLynx/givetu).
- You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.

    ![Image](-----)
- The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your CLI with `git clone <paste url>`.
- The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine. The files can then be uploaded to your IDE.

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

In the Terminal window:

- Navigate to the folder of the installed files with `cd <path>`
- Create the virtual environment folder with `python -m venv venv`
- Activate the virtual environment with `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

*Note: The above commands were used on Visual Studio Code on Windows. For other IDE's and Linux, please refer to [Creation of Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)*

#### 3. Create Environmental Variables

#### 4. Create a .gitignore file

- Create a file called **.gitignore** in the root directory and ensure it contains the following git exclusions:

```text
    core.Microsoft*
    core.mongo*
    core.python*
    env.py
    __pycache__/
    *.py[cod]
    venv
    .vscode
    *.sqlite3
    *.pyc
```

#### 5. Install project dependencies

- Install project requirements by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### 6. --------------

#### 7. Deploy locally

- To run the project locally, in the terminal type `python manage.py runserver`
- This will open a localhost address, which is provided in the CLI.
- Either copy and paste the url shown below into a new browser tab, or hover over it and click *follow link*

#### 8. Remote Deployment on Heroku
