## Overview

Around the world, there are incredible endevours, which work tirelessly and selflessly towards supporting imporverished communities, protecting natural wildlife and sustaining environmental resources.

One of the main sources of income for these projects has been from the International Volunteer platform, which grew rapidly in popularity in the mid-90's. Volunteer Organisations offered a structured way for people to travel to far-out destinations for a set fee, which enabled the orginations to thrive and grow. The knock-on effect was that these organisations were able to assist more projects as they grew by provinding funding to them for each volunteer they send. The immense benefit to the projects was not only in the form of fnancial support, but provided physical presence of volunteers to assist with various tasks, which the projects could otherwise not afford to hire staff for.

The onset of the COVID crisis in early 2020 brought international travel to an abrupt halt, and as a result, a huge majority of Volunteer Organisations stopped operating. This, of course, meant that the projects' main source of income ceased almost immediately and significantly impeded the projects' ability to run effectively.

FundPIN (Fund Projects In Need) is dedicated to networking, supporting, and raising funds for non-profit organisations worldwide by providing an online platform, whereby users can find projects they are interested in supporting, donate to them directly through the site, and get updates on the progression and status of each.

## UX

This website project

### 1. Strategy

The audience target demographic is all-encompassing in terms of cultures and ages, so the prime strategy is to keep the site easy to use, yet fresh, uplifting and current. From experience, people do want to get involved and need to feel confident that the support that they are providing is going to the correct source. Supporters who donate are provided with factual information regarding the amount donated, the amount that reaches the project itself and the amount that FundPIN retains as a small percentage to enable the project to be sustainable. This detailed information is excluded from majority 'donation' type sites, so users never really know where their donation has ended up.

#### Project and User Goals

- The branch was then merged with the main branch after any conflicts were addressed.

### IDE

- All code was written on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a local IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
- A virtual environment was created on VSCode to ensure that the packages installed are only installed in the virtual environment folder.
- The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/JimLynx/givetu).

> [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)  

## Deployment

### Local Installation

#### 1. Cloning the project

- The code can be run locally through clone or download from the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/JimLynx/givetu).
- You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.

    ![Image](-----)
- The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your CLI with `git clone <paste url>`.
- The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine. The files can then be uploaded to your IDE.

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

In the Terminal window:

- Navigate to the folder of the installed files with `cd <path>`
- Create the virtual environment folder with `python -m venv venv`
- Activate the virtual environment with `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

*Note: The above commands were used on Visual Studio Code on Windows. For other IDE's and Linux, please refer to [Creation of Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)*

#### 3. Create Environmental Variables

#### 4. Create a .gitignore file

- Create a file called **.gitignore** in the root directory and ensure it contains the following git exclusions:

```text
    core.Microsoft*
    core.mongo*
    core.python*
    env.py
    __pycache__/
    *.py[cod]
    venv
    .vscode
    *.sqlite3
    *.pyc
```

#### 5. Install project dependencies

- Install project requirements by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### 6. --------------

-
![database Entity Relational Diagram](----------------)

#### 7. Deploy locally

- To run the project locally, in the terminal type `python manage.py runserver`
- This will open a localhost address, which is provided in the CLI.
- Either copy and paste the url shown below into a new browser tab, or hover over it and click *follow link*

#### 8. Remote Deployment on Heroku
