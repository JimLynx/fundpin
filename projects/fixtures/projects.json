This is why they are strategically located within these neighbourhoods, to be closer to the people. They are also the first place to go when you have a health problem and need professional assistance. In primary care centres there are family doctors, paediatricians, nurses, psychologists, dentists and social workers among other specialties. It is also worth mentioning that in Argentina, Primary Care Centres are free to all.",
