        "description": "<p>Primary care or &quot;salitas&quot; - in Spanish - are the first level of access for the residents in poor neighbourhoods. This is why they are strategically located within these neighbourhoods, to be closer to the people. They are also the first place to go when you have a health problem and need professional assistance. In primary care centres there are family doctors, paediatricians, nurses, psychologists, dentists and social workers among other specialties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This health centre has many medical specialties, but they also give a lot of importance to preventive medicine and the promotion of health in the neighbourhood. The doctors and nurses organize campaigns and workshops for the community; visit their homes in order to understand the social and economic root of health issues, and to help more effectively. The &ldquo;Centro de Atenci&oacute;n Primaria&rdquo; (Basic Health Care Centre) has a comprehensive health concept that goes beyond the biological fact of the illness. Health is understood as a process affected by various causes, including poverty.&nbsp;Therefore, the doctors mainly promote community participation in preventing and finding solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This health centre was founded in 1941 by a group of neighbors of the town of Ramos Mejia, in the outskirts of Buenos Aires city. They realized about of the lack of medical attention and started to work only by donations and little fees charged to the patients. During the last economic crisis in Argentina the centre was about to close, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the commitment of the neighbors. Today the medical centre keeps working in the same way. The doctors work there for a minimal salary and they are committed and very aware of the importance of their help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The centre provides professionals in several medical specialties: pediatrics, gynecology, dentistry, orthopedics, kinesiology, orthopedics, cardiology, clinical medicine, psychiatry and psychology. Also two nurses of the town help the doctors and the volunteers that go there interested in knowing their way of working.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This&nbsp;Centre has been successfully running the monkey rehabilitation programme for over 20 years and it is the first and only centre for rehabilitation of primates in Argentina; and the only one which works to rehabilitate howler monkeys in the world. The centre consists of various stages of physical, psychological and social rehabilitation or as they say &ldquo;We teach the monkeys to be monkeys again&rdquo;. The centre works with orphaned monkeys turned &ldquo;mistakenly&rdquo; into pets. All have been taken from their natural habitats to satisfy the pet trade and to be held as exhibits in zoos. All the monkeys have come from voluntary hand-ins, seizures by the government, zoo&rsquo;s etc from all over the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the pet trade still exits in South America and although howler monkeys are a protected species in Argentina, enforcement of this status is not effective. It is now listed in CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) as &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo;. Continued hunting for the bush meat and pet trades and habitat destruction ensure that numbers in the wild are still declining rapidly. The &ldquo;Refugio Del Caraya&rdquo; was the first place in Argentina where the Black Howler Monkeys bred successfully outside their native habitat. This species is considered worldwide &ldquo;difficult to maintain in captivity&rdquo; &ndash; generally it does not survive and/or reproduce in zoos. There are more than 100 monkeys which live free in 9 sectors within the refuge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also a few monkeys that cannot live with other monkeys or prefer to be alone or with humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three key challenges facing Howler Monkeys in Argentina at present, all of which are sadly contributing to their decline:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"margin-left:40px\">\r\n\t<li>Their <strong>natural environment is declining</strong> at an alarming rate due to forestry and agricultural activities. This reduces the natural habitat in which they can live.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Poaching </strong>is also widespread, with many baby monkeys being illegally separated from their mothers and sold on as pets. It is estimated that, sadly, only one baby out of every six that are captured survives.</li>\r\n\t<li>Out of the <strong>monkeys that are kept as pets</strong>, many are mistreated and eventually abandoned &ndash; leaving them extremely vulnerable in the wild.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The monkeys that are fortunate enough to be rescued are brought into the Centre, often in a terrible condition. Many are malnourished, and unable to fend for themselves after being separated from their mother. The work of this project is absolutely vital in ensuring the monkey population in Argentina does not decline any further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project has <strong>three main aims</strong> &ndash; to <strong>rescue</strong>, <strong>rehabilitate </strong>and eventually <strong>release </strong>the monkeys back into the wild, so that they are self-sufficient. Some monkeys are unfortunately unable to be rehabilitated due to their condition and, because of this they are cared for permanently at the Centre.</p>",

There are up to 100 dolphins living in the Bay and groups of them regularly visit the shallow waters in front of the DDC (known as the Interactive Zone). It was opened in 1994, and is the first of its kind dedicated entirely to dolphin research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the mid-1960&rsquo;s, a local resident, began feeding the dolphins from a small jetty near her home on the Leschenault Inlet (directly south of the centre). Unfortunately, she passed away in the early 70&#39;s ceasing any regular feeding of the dolphins she befriended. Some dolphins continued to be fed by the public from areas nearby. However, it wasn&#39;t until 1989 that a dolphin specialist was hired by the newly established&nbsp;Trust to continue this tradition and begin feeding and studying the local dolphins of Koombana Bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From this work came the establishment of the Interaction Zone in 1990, and the Centre in 1994, to allow tourists and members of the community to interact, understand and enjoy the group of five to six dolphins that regularly visit this zone. Direct interaction with these magnificent creatures is a very positive way to encourage continued marine awareness and education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not clear why the dolphins continue to visit the Zone today however research does suggest that the small amount of food they receive as a reward for their visit is not the only attraction. There are many dolphins that visit the Zone regularly that do not receive any fish and many of them stay for extended periods of time for interaction with the human visitors. Sick and injured dolphins also treat the beach as a haven, with some repeatedly visiting during periods of illness or injury.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Currently there 1000&#39;s of lions living in canned-hunting facilities throughout South Africa, which are predominantly stocked by the &#39;cub-petting&#39; trade. Majority of these facilities are over-stocked, with lions living in cramped and horrendous conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working in conjunction with wildlife professionals and support from local authorities, the project has taken over a previous breeding and hunting facility, along with 90 lions that were living in dire conditions. Found starving and extremely thin, the initial priority has been to feed and allow the lions to get back to their optimal weight and health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are also erecting much larger enclosures and semi-wild enclosures (wild camps), which are enormous compared to what the lions have had to live in previously. The lions will be undergoing their rehabilitation in a safe sanctuary setting, with some of them starting out in smaller camps, to familiarise themselves with their new surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As these lions have been captive bred, they are familiar with human interaction. Sadly, in the petting trade, cubs are generally taken away from their mothers at around 3 weeks old and will never see her again. Humans (usually paying guests) are used as 'surrogate mothers' to the cubs. This, along with the fact that the lion industry has irresponsibly bred lions so badly, means that the gene pool/quality is adversely affected, and they can never be released back into natural wild areas. The reason for this is that if they were to breed with wild lions, this would have disastrous consequences for the future of wild lion populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, the end-goal aim of this project is to rehabilitate these lions back into a safe, semi-wild environment, using the huge camps as semi-free-roaming areas for rescued lions to live out their years in a safer and more natural environment.</p>",
